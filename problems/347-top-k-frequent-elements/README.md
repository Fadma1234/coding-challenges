Top K Frequent Elements
======================

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique. You may return the output in any order.

Example:

- Input: `nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `[2,3]`
